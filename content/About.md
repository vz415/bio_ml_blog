# About
My name is Vincent Zaballa. I am a biomedical engineer by training and 
education, and a data scientist by trial and error. My interests lie 
within the realm of medical devices, ranging from tissue engineering 
 to deep learning diagnostics, and the practical implementations
of those technologies. 

When I'm not writing about medical devices or prototyping deep 
learning models, I take freelance work to help pay the bills. Please 
get in touch if you would like more information.
