My name is Vincent Zaballa. I am a biomedical engineer by training and 
education, and a data scientist by trial and error. Currently, I am 
especially interested in the application
of deep learning models to healthcare applications to aid in diagnostics,
material selection, and medical device simulation. Check out my CV for 
more information regarding my interests and background.

When I'm not writing about medical devices, participating in hackathons/entrepreneurial competitions, 
or prototyping deep learning models, I take freelance work. Please 
get in touch if you would like to discuss any data science or deep 
learning projects you have and would like assistance completing.
