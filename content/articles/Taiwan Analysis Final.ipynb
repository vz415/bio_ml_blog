    "# Credit Card Default Analysis\n",
    "This notebook will be dedicated to analyzing credit card records from payments in Taiwan using logistic regression and comparing various models. Logistic regression can be seen as the building block of neural networks, so a good fundamental understanding of this basic model will help the reader better understand neural nets and how they can optimize their performance. To do this, I will go from a basic model to using under and over-sampling techniques with regularization techniques to optimize model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a short read, so please feel free to skip to the section you care about. Here's a TLDR for the time-starved: \n",
    "- Imbalanced datasets can cause big headaches, so it's worth it to manipulate your data to achieve a better balance.\n",
    "- ML practitioners should experiment with different models.\n",
    "- Optimizing models for the wrong measurement (e.g. Accuracy instead of F1 score) will get you nowhere fast.\n",
    "- Logistic regression is a great preprocessing tool to help you get a good feel for the dataset before training large and complicated neural nets, so get comfortable with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset I am using in this project is aimed at the case of customer default payments in Taiwan (Yeh and Lien, 2006) and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among data mining methods, with explanations of each step required to go from the imported data to data that can be used to classify defaults. For classification, I start by applying simple classification algorithms to the problem and assessing their accuracy using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and a ROC curves, when needed. This will conclude the first portion of this project, as this will tell how accurate traditional methods of classification are when trying to predict credit card defaults within this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. While initial results from training l1 and l2 logistic regression models on the imbalanced dataset were not satisfactory, which I am attributing to the imbalance of outcomes within the dataset, I address this problem by optimizing for recall within Sci-kit learn's 'GridsearchCV' module, and using under and over-sampling techniques from the python package \"imblearn\". I assess and compare the performance metrics among the original, under, and over-sampled models, with results indicating that both over and under-sampling improve the recall rates for predicting credit card defaults by an equivalent amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I was able to maximize the recall rates by using under and over-sampling techniques, the precision rates dropped significantly. For the purpose of this project and the context of this notebook, I will conclude with a statement about optimality of precision and how to proceed.\n",

    "The dataset employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. The study used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables: \n",
    "- X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit. \n",
    "- X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female). \n",
    "- X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = other). \n",
    "- X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = other). \n",
    "- X5: Age (year). \n",
    "- X6 - X11: History of past payment. They tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = duly paid; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above. \n",
    "- X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005. \n",
    "- X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005. \n",

    "One-hot encoding is useful in python to help train any type of model that contains categorical features. One-hot encoding works by encoding variables that take categorical values, as combinations of binary variables representing the occurence of each possible unique categorical value for that variable. In this case, there are 9 different features that contain categorical values. Within those columns, there are varying options for distinction, such as sex having 2 options and history of past payment having 10 different values. One-hot encoding will split each of these columns into columns that have one category in the column, and whether or not that value is present in the row. Going back to the 'sex' category, this will split it into two columns called: \"SEX_male\" and \"SEX_female\", each of which will only contain binary variables.\n",

    "# 2. Data Story\n",
    "In 2006, Taiwan faced a credit crisis that came to a head in the third quarter of 2006. This all started with banks over-issuing cash and credit to unqualified applicants and was catalyzed by many cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overusing their credit cards for consumption, accruing heavy credit and cash-card debts. This crisis warranted more thorough investigation into improved techniques for assessing the probability of default by each individual consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that is used in this project has been collected by Yeh and Lien (see the reference at the end of this notebook), and consists of \"payment data in October, 2005, from an important bank in Taiwan. In summary, there are 23 features of the dataset that can be explored to get a better understanding of the information provided. Some features are time-series related information, such as the history of past payments, amount of bill statements in NT dollars, and the amount of previous payments. These are abstract concepts and, while they may be informative on their own for a machine learning model, they are quite hard to understand as they are right now, separated by columns for each individual. To rectify this issue, I will construct visualizations that show where the state of the Taiwan economy is from April to September of 2015, by each individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I'll construct a parallel coordinates graph for three sets of data: History of past payment (X6-X11), amount of bill statement (X12-X17), and amount of previous payment (X18-X23). Parallel coordinate graphs are especially useful for visualizing trends in clustered or labeled data, but since this dataset is on a continuous scale, I'll start by just observing overall trends."

    "The plots of the subset of the population are similar in that they show an increase in variance in the bill amount over time and a gradual increase in the mean bill amount.

    "- The bill amount seems fairly steady over time, with a slight increase in average debt and increase in the variance of debt. \n",
    "- The payments fluctuate each month, with the average being below the average payments. Also, note how cyclical the payments are. It's almost as if the consumer saves more one month, then pays off the bill, then saves, then pays, and so on. \n",
    "- The last two plots are the parallel coordinate plots for customers who started with 0-100k and 100k-200k NT Dollars of debt. These graphs show a gradual creep upwards and away from the starting average debt, something that was more significant with the 0-100k range of values. Each coordinate plot showed an increase in the variance in the amount of debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, parallel coordinate plots work better whenever there are groups and you want to see how those groups interact. For example, using Fisher's iris flower dataset to observe the changes between variables. Here, I arbitrarly grouped some users who I thought would be more responsible with payments, people with debt between 0-100k NT Dollars, and found that even here, they accumulated debt.  I then graphed 100k-200k NT Dollars and saw a similar trend. Had I chosen a monther earlier or later, it could have been a totally different group of people. While the decision of where to graph the subsets of the population was arbitrary, the graphs were still noteworthy as the mean and variance increased over time for each subset of the population.\n",

    "These scatter plots are rather noisy and not really formatted to display information that well. I have looked for a 'jitter' option within pandas plotting to allow for the density of the points to be displayed, rather than just a single point. For example, we cannot infer anything about the relation between education and defaulting with the current information, as each dot is superimposed over another, distorting any information that might be relayed easily here. As well, it would be nice for the categories to have space around the edges so that readers don't confuse categories and their distributions. I know how to do this in ggplot for R, but am still relatively new to plotting in Python, so I'll experiment with packages to achieve these goals later.\n",

    "We've used coordinate plots extensively to see time series relationships of Taiwan credit card customers' debt and payment histories. From these graphical representations, we were able to see that the average debt was increasing while average payment was low and cyclical. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use time series analysis to understand this trend and how much debt each person would have in a month, I believe there would be too much noise and variability among customers to accurately do this. Instead, I will resort to creating classification algorithms that take each variable and category into account for a model that can classify to a degree of accuracy whether a person will default in October of 2005. The next thing will be to apply inferential statistics to these findings to test hypotheses about relationships in the data, such as the whether less-educated people are more likely to default on their next payment."

The bigger difference here is between L1 and L2 regularization, of which, L1 performed much better than L2. Even when optimized for recall, L2 was not able to return a satisfactory result.

    "There is an imbalance in the dataset that cannot be solved by simply optimizing the penalty parameters of L1-logistic regression. Instead, I will need to either under-sample or over-sample the dataset to balance the two. According to the rules of thumb listed below, I can choose from under-sampling or over-sampling to balance the dataset. I can do both and compare their Accuracy and precision-recall metric in order to determine which method improves the model the most. Additionally, I will experiment with random and non-random sampling schemes for over-sampling and under-sampling. From here on I will refer to the class with more elements as the \"majority class\" and the one with less as the \"minority class\". \n",

    "### Note: Accuracy and Recall Optimized GridsearchCV\n",
    "As expected, there is a change in recall score when optimized for recall as opposed to accuracy. However, it's interesting to note that the recall-optimized L1 has a lower overall recall than accuracy-optimized L1 logistic regression. The recall would be higher for the recall-optimized L1 logistic regression, but it is not. Further investigation needs to be done with a graphical interpretation of the values. I will plot these on a precision-recall curve, later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Undersampling Result Interpretation\n",
    "As mentioned, there was not a difference between optimizing for accuracy and recall. There was a large difference in recall between L1 and L2 optimized results. The L1 logistic regression has a better score for predicting the non-default class, whereas the L2 logistic regression is better at predicting for the default (Y=1) class. The default logistic regression algorithm didn't do too bad, but that's mainly because it is using L2 regularization under the hood and the optimal lambda value of C=1. I will leave out the default parameter from here on out, as I just wanted to show that it can return a decent accuracy or recall measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Oversampling\n",
    "Now that we've seen some results for undersampling the majority class, let's take a look at oversampling the minority class. This time, I am just going to optimize the parameters on the 'recall' measurement and leave out the default logistic regression value."

    "Scaling the variables before training a model seems to normalize the results between L1 and L2 regularization. Generally, all of the models that were scaled performed better at increasing precision while most of the models from the original dataset (all except one) returned a higher recall metric than the scaled models. Since we are trying to maximize the recall for the default class (Y=1), I will continue with the non-scaled models.\n",

For example, if someone is labeled as liable to default but does not, how will that affect the bank?

    "# 7. Conclusions & Summary of Findings\n",
    "The original goal of this project was to assess the dataset and create a classification model that would maximize the number of default customers predicted. In the process of examining the data, I discovered an imbalance in the response variable that provided problems in predicting for the minority class of data, default customers who I wanted to predict would default on their next payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy this case of class imbalance, where about 20% of the response lay within the minority class and the rest in the majority class, I employed resampling techniques to adjust the ratio of minority class to majority class. The undersampling algorithm I used took random samples from the majority class to match the number of samples in the minority class. The oversampling algorithm is known as SMOTE and is a sophisticated method of creating new minority measurements, but has its drawbacks. Both under and over-sampling return improved modeling results for this imbalanced dataset by improving the recall of the minority class. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then scaled the data by subtracting the mean amount from each column and dividing by the standard deviation. After scaling, I employed both resampling techniques and optimized for recall, since that clearly returned the maximum recall score for the minority class. The results showed an overall increased precision values for all of the models and for both resampling techniques, but the recall for the minority class stagnated around a value of 0.60, where a value of 0.75 was achieved with non-scaled and oversampled L2 logistic regression. While there are costs associated with lower precision, it is up to the user and model-builder to determine how many false positives are acceptable for the application in question.\n",

    "To improve models, here are the steps that I would take:\n",
    "1. Use the current process to compare to different algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, KNN, discriminant bayes, and neural networks.\n",
    "2. Adjust the classification threshold. Instead of making 50% probability of default, I could shift that threshold up and down to adjust recall and precision rates. In practice, this is useful as precision cannot be ignored, as there are also costs associated with lower precision rates.\n",
    "3. Adjust the resampling techniques. The package Imblearn provides many different options for undersampling and oversampling, of which I can experiment with new methods to improve precision and recall rates. Do this step in combination with the previous steps.\n",

    "## Comparison to Parent Study\n",
    "This project dove into the details of resampling techniques and how they can benefit classification algorithms. I focused on logistic regression models and two resampling techniques to thoroughly examine the benefits of optimizing for accuracy and recall, as well as observing the effect that resampling had on improving model performance. With the process in place for imbalanced data, I can then compare models that have employed resampling and to models that do not need to resample, such as random forest or CART models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the original paper focused on predicting the actual probability of default by employing a novel measurement technique. To measure the accuracy of their prediction models, they used a gains chart to measure the increase in prediction capability for each model they used. They used the ratio of the area under the predictive model divided by the area under a perfect model to return a single number for model accuracy. However, this study did not employ resampling methods to improve model performance, as the main goal of their paper was to assess a novel method for assessing the real probability of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the authors did not use resampling techniques to improve their models, it would be interesting to compare results with updated model predictions. While lift charts are not directly linked to recall, it would be interesting to see how our results compare. Due to time constraints, I will leave construction of lift charts and comparison to the parent paper's results for future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project showed steps on how to deal with imbalanced data and observed improved recall rates for both L1 and L2 regularized logistic regression when resampling was employed. Oversampling performed slightly better than undersampling for improving recall rates of the minority class. Future analysis will dive into why oversampling did better in this case and what other resampling techniques might improve model performance for this particular dataset."
