Welcome to my online CV. Links to relevant literature related to my history can be found here. As well, this will eventually become a place to blog about bioengineering, machine learning, and how to write stellar SBIR grants, with an emphasis on the former two. Seeking summer 2023 research scientist internships. [Follow me on twitter!](https://twitter.com/VZaballa)
